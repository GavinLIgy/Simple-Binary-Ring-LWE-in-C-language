In Book [Hardware Security] and [Binary Ring-LWE Hardware with Power Side-Channel Countermeasures],
  Ring R_q=Z_q[x]/<x^n+1> :
    All the elements inside this ring are polynomials of degree n-1 with integer coefficients modulo q.
    The operations defined are: polynomial addition, polynomial subtraction, and polynomial multiplication.
      Polynomial addition and polynomial subtraction: coefficient-wise, modular addition and subtraction operations, respectively.
      Polynomial multiplication: generates a 2n-2 degree polynomial which is converted back to a polynomial of degree n-1 with the reduction function of f(x)=x^n+1.
